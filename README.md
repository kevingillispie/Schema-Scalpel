## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is schema markup?

Schema markup (structured data) is code that helps search engines understand your website’s content, such as articles, products, or FAQs. It enhances search results with rich snippets, improving visibility and clicks.

### Does Schema Scalpel work with Yoast or All in One SEO?

Yes! Schema Scalpel integrates seamlessly with Yoast SEO and All in One SEO Pack, allowing you to disable their schema output and use custom JSON-LD markup instead.

### What’s new in version 1.6?

Version 1.6 introduces database schema improvements for better performance, a “Settings” link on the Plugins page for quick access, and a `delete_on_uninstall` setting to control data removal during uninstallation.

### Why use JSON-LD instead of microdata?

JSON-LD is Google’s preferred format for structured data because it’s easier to manage within a single `<script>` tag, unlike microdata, which is embedded throughout HTML. Schema Scalpel uses JSON-LD for simplicity and compliance.
